# README

## Overview
This project contains **Google Colab notebooks** and a **Power BI dashboard** for analyzing Air Quality Index (AQI) data across major Indian cities and employee work preference data. Follow the instructions below to successfully run the notebooks and generate the required outputs.

---

## 1. **MSc_Project_AQI.ipynb**

### Input Files Required
Upload the following CSV files into Colab before running the notebook:
- `Bangalore_AQI_Dataset.csv`
- `Chennai_AQI_Dataset.csv`
- `Delhi_AQI_Dataset.csv`
- `Mumbai_AQI_Dataset.csv`

### Steps to Run in Google Colab
1. Open **MSc_Project_AQI.ipynb** in Google Colab.
2. Upload the datasets listed above using the Colab file upload option.
3. Run all cells in the notebook.
4. The code will generate a combined dataset:
   - **`Combined_AQI_Data.csv`**
5. Upload the generated `Combined_AQI_Data.csv` back into Colab.
6. Run the remaining cleaning and sorting steps.
7. The final cleaned file will be created as:
   - **`Combined_AQI_Final_Cleaned.csv`**

## 2. **MSc_Project_Employee_Preferences_Analysis.ipynb**

### Input File Required
Upload the following CSV file into Colab before running the notebook:
- `WFH_WFO_dataset.csv`

### Steps to Run in Google Colab
1. Open **MSc_Project_Employee_Preferences_Analysis.ipynb** in Google Colab.
2. Upload the dataset using the Colab file upload option.
3. Run all cells in the notebook to execute the analysis.

## 3. **Interactive AQI Dashboard (Power BI)**

### File Required
- `MSc_Project_AQI_Dashboard.pbix`

### Steps to Open
1. Open the file **MSc_Project_AQI_Dashboard.pbix** in Power BI Desktop.
2. The dashboard will provide an **interactive visualization** of AQI trends across the cities.
3. Use the filters and slicers to explore the data regionally and compare city-level AQI variations.

## Notes
- Ensure the dataset filenames match exactly as listed above.
- These instructions are intended for **testing** the Python code and exploring the **interactive dashboard**.
- Run each notebook separately with its corresponding dataset.
